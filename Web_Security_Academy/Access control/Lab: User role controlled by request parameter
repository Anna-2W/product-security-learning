This lab has an admin panel at /admin, which identifies administrators using a forgeable cookie.

🛠️ Steps to Solve
Log in as a regular user
Use the provided credentials:

Username: wiener
Password: peter

Browse the application
After login, navigate around the site and look at the cookies stored in your browser.

You’ll probably see a cookie like:
Admin=false

This hints that admin status is controlled client-side using a simple cookie.
Try to access /admin
Go to /admin — you’ll likely be blocked or redirected since you're not an admin.
Modify the cookie

Change the Admin=false cookie to Admin=true using browser dev tools or an intercepting proxy like Burp Suite.

Refresh the page or revisit /admin.

Access the admin panel

Now, you should be able to access the admin functionality.

Delete Carlos

✅ Lab solved!
