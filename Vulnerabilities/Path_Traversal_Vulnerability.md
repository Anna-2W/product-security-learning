# 🛡️ Path Traversal Vulnerability

## 📌 What is Path Traversal?

**Path Traversal**, also known as **Directory Traversal**, is a server-side vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files outside the intended directory. By manipulating file paths, attackers can read **arbitrary files** on the file system where the web application is running.

These files may include:

- Application source code
- Back-end configuration files
- Credentials (e.g., API keys, database passwords)
- Operating system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
- Other sensitive or restricted resources

In some cases, attackers can even **write** to arbitrary files, potentially modifying system behavior or achieving remote code execution.

## 🧪 How Does It Work?

Consider a shopping website that displays product images using the following HTML:

```html
<img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png">
Behind the scenes, the application may construct the full path like this:

/var/www/images/ + filename
→ /var/www/images/218.png

If the application does not sanitize user input, an attacker could exploit this by providing path traversal sequences in the filename parameter:

/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd

This would result in:
/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd → /etc/passwd
This traversal (../) moves up the directory tree and accesses system-level files.

On Windows systems, both ../ and ..\ are interpreted as parent directory traversal. For example:
/loadImage?filename=..\..\..\windows\win.ini


🧠 Summary
Vulnerability: Improper validation of file paths.

Impact: Unauthorized file access, potential code execution.

Exploited via: Manipulating query parameters like filename=../../../etc/passwd



✅ Prevention
Never use raw user input to build file paths.
Use a whitelist of allowed filenames or identifiers.
Normalize and sanitize all user-provided input.
Use secure APIs or libraries that resolve paths safely.
Limit file system permissions of the application user.
