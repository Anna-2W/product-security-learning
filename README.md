# Product Security Learning

Welcome! ðŸš€

This repository tracks my journey into Application Security (AppSec) and Product Security.  
It contains learning notes, lab reports, tool references, and small secure coding projects.

## ðŸ“š Sections

- **Vulnerabilities**  
  Learning notes on major web vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, IDOR, SSRF, etc.)

- **Labs**  
  Reports and summaries from hands-on labs (TryHackMe, PortSwigger, OWASP Juice Shop, etc.)

- **Tools**  
  Quick guides, command references, and usage tips for AppSec tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Semgrep, etc.

- **Projects** *(coming soon)*  
  Small projects focused on secure coding practices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build strong foundations in Application Security.
- Practice both offensive (attack) and defensive (protection) techniques.
- Document and share my progress publicly.

## ðŸ§  Notes

This repository is a personal learning resource.  
It is constantly updated as I study and practice AppSec topics.
